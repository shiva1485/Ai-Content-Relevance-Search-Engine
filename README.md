# AI-Powered GitHub Search Engine

An AI-powered search engine that allows users to search GitHub repositories intelligently using natural language queries. This search engine integrates with an LLM (Language Model) to enhance the search experience by understanding user intent and providing more relevant results, along with repository suggestions.

## Overview

This project is designed to enhance GitHubâ€™s search functionality by allowing users to:
- Search repositories based on natural language input.
- Receive intelligent search results using a pre-trained language model (LLM).
- Get repository recommendations based on search results and repository metadata.

By leveraging AI, the search engine can understand complex user queries and return relevant repositories more effectively than traditional keyword-based search engines.

## Features

- **Natural Language Query Support**: Understands user intent and searches repositories based on more than just keywords.
- **LLM Integration**: Utilizes a pre-trained language model (GPT or similar) to interpret search queries.
- **Repository Suggestions**: Provides related repository suggestions based on the content of the search results.
- **Advanced Search**: Allows users to search repositories by code snippets, dependencies, or patterns.
  
## Architecture

The basic architecture of the project consists of:
1. **Frontend**: A web-based UI where users can enter search queries.
2. **Backend**: A server that handles requests, processes queries using the LLM, and interacts with the GitHub API.
3. **AI Engine**: The core AI module that processes and refines user queries using an LLM to understand context and intent.
4. **GitHub API**: Used to retrieve repositories, code, and issues based on refined search terms.
5. **Result Ranking**: Results are ranked and filtered for relevance, and suggestions are made based on search trends and metadata.
